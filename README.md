## Brief Overview
This Flask-based web application creates POST and GET requests based on the user-entered location, calls the Wolfram|Alpha Short Answers API, and then displays the location on the map alongside the information. The API calls are written in Python while the front-end displays the data in real-time with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
